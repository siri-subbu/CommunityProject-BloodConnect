    <h1>Donor Declaration and Consent</h1>

    <h3>1. Voluntary Participation</h3>
    <p>
      I am registering as a donor of my own free will. I understand that my participation is voluntary and that my information will be used for the purpose of donor coordination, awareness, and communication.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Eligibility</h3>
    <p>
      I confirm that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I am at least 18 years of age.</li>
      <li>I am in good physical and mental health.</li>
      <li>I have not donated blood or plasma within the medically recommended interval period.</li>
      <li>I am not suffering from any infectious or transmissible diseases that could make me ineligible to donate.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I understand that my final eligibility will be determined during medical screening before any donation.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Accuracy of Information</h3>
    <p>
      I declare that all the details I provide in this registration form are true, complete, and accurate to the best of my knowledge. I understand that providing false information may result in my removal from the donor registry.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Data Privacy and Usage</h3>
    <p>
      I understand that my personal information will be used only for maintaining the donor registry, verifying my eligibility, and contacting me about donation opportunities. My data will be stored securely and will not be shared with any third party without my consent, except where required by law.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Communication Consent</h3>
    <p>
      I agree to be contacted by authorized representatives through phone, SMS, or email for donation opportunities, health checks, or awareness programs related to donor activities.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Medical Responsibility</h3>
    <p>
      I understand that my registration does not guarantee eligibility to donate. I agree to undergo the necessary medical screening and accept that the final decision rests with the medical team. I release the organization from responsibility for any medical complications arising from conditions I did not disclose truthfully.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Withdrawal of Consent</h3>
    <p>
      I understand that I can withdraw my registration at any time by contacting 
      <a href="mailto:contact@blooddonor.org">contact@blooddonor.org</a>. 
      Upon my request, my personal data will be permanently removed from the donor records.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Acknowledgment</h3>
    <p>
      By submitting my registration form, I confirm that I have read and understood this declaration. I willingly agree to all the terms mentioned above and consent to the responsible use of my data for donor-related purposes.
